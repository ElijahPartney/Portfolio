                    <p> Hi, my name is Elijah and I'm a 13-year-old web developer! I've been interested in computers and technology for as long as I can remember, and I've always loved tinkering with gadgets and figuring out how they work. When I discovered web development, I was hooked - it was the perfect combination of creativity and problem-solving, and I loved being able to see my creations come to life.
                        I started learning HTML and CSS on my own, using online resources and tutorials to guide me. It wasn't always easy, but I was determined to keep going and learn as much as I could. I also dabbled in Python, which gave me a taste of the possibilities of programming beyond web development.
                        Although I'm still relatively new to web development, I've already created this portfolio showcasing my work. This Portfolio shows an example of my skils is Html, CSS, And the very little java knolwadge i have. I enjoy experimenting with different design techniques and exploring new features and tools. While I have some experience with JavaScript, I know I have a lot to learn, and I'm excited to continue developing my skills and creating even more advanced projects in the future.
                        When I'm not coding, I love spending time with my family, playing games with my siblings, and trying new foods. Pizza is one of my all-time favorite foods, and I love trying out different toppings and crusts. I also have a bit of a sweet tooth, and I can never resist the salty taste of Recess candy - it's one of my guilty pleasures!
                        I'm thrilled to be able to share my passion for web development with you through my portfolio, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me!</p>
