                    <p> Hi, my name is Elijah and I'm a 13-year-old web developer! I've been interested in computers and technology for as long as I can remember, and I've always loved tinkering with gadgets and figuring out how they work. When I discovered web development, I was hooked - it was the perfect combination of creativity and problem-solving, and I loved being able to see my creations come to life on the internet.
                        I started learning HTML and CSS on my own, using online resources and tutorials to guide me. It wasn't always easy, but I was determined to keep going and learn as much as I could. I also dabbled in Python, which gave me a taste of the possibilities of programming beyond web development.
                        Although I'm still relatively new to web development, I've already created several websites, including this portfolio showcasing my work. I enjoy experimenting with different design techniques and exploring new features and tools. While I have some experience with JavaScript, I know I have a lot to learn, and I'm excited to continue developing my skills and creating even more advanced projects in the future.
                        When I'm not coding, I love spending time with my family, playing games with my siblings, and trying new foods. Pizza is one of my all-time favorite foods, and I love trying out different toppings and crusts. I also have a bit of a sweet tooth, and I can never resist the salty taste of Recess candy - it's one of my guilty pleasures!
                        I'm thrilled to be able to share my passion for web development with you through my portfolio, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me!</p>
